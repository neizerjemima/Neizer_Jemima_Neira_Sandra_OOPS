## Description

The Boba Mood Generator is a JavaScript project inspired by the movie "Inside Out," where different emotions are associated with various boba tea flavours. This project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create an interactive boba choice generator based on the user's mood selection.

## Features

Emotion Selection: Users can choose their current mood by clicking on emotion images, which are inspired by the characters from the movie "Inside Out."

Boba Tea Recommendations: Upon selecting an emotion, the generator provides the user with a recommended boba tea flavour along with its recipe. Each mood corresponds to a specific boba tea flavour, ensuring a personalized boba experience based on the user's emotional state.

Smooth Scrolling: The project incorporates GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth scrolling effects, enhancing the user experience when navigating through the page.

## Implementation

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Each mood and its corresponding boba tea flavour are implemented as objects in JavaScript, following OOP principles. This modular approach allows for easy maintenance and scalability of the project.

Dynamic Content Creation: Boba tea recommendations are dynamically generated based on the user's mood selection. The content, including images, quotes, boba tea names, and recipes, is dynamically inserted into the webpage to provide a seamless user experience.
